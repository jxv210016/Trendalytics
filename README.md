# Trendalytics

Trendalytics is a web application that analyzes and visualizes sentiment data related to various companies based on news articles. The application is divided into two parts:

- The **Frontend** is built using React and provides a user interface for users to search for companies and view sentiment analysis results, as well as recent search history.

- The **Backend** is built using Flask and serves as the API for sentiment analysis and news article retrieval. It provides endpoints for sentiment analysis and data retrieval.

Users can search for a company by entering its name, and the application will provide sentiment analysis results, as well as a list of relevant news articles. The application aims to help users gauge public sentiment towards companies based on news coverage.
